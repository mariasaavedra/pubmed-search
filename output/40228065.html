          Heart failure is a growing health-care concern affecting tens of
          millions of individuals globally. Although traditional therapeutic
          strategies have focused on reducing the risk for hospitalization and
          mortality, the importance of patient-reported outcomes (PROs) in
          patients with heart failure is increasingly being recognized.
          Regulatory agencies consider PROs part of their evaluation of drugs
          and devices, and professional society guidelines may recommend
          interventions that improve PROs. However, for several reasons, the
          effect of interventions on PROs reported in heart failure trials
          currently is difficult to interpret. There is no consensus on the
          timing and frequency of PRO assessments. Moreover, it has been
          difficult to establish a minimal clinically important difference, that
          is, the minimal change in a PRO score that is meaningful to a patient.
          In addition, traditional methods of analyzing and reporting PROs such
          as comparison of mean differences across groups or responder analysis
          are prone to statistical artifacts and misinterpretation. This article
          presents an in-depth discussion of these issues, with the Kansas City
          Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire used as an example, to facilitate the use
          of PROs in heart failure research, regulatory, and clinical settings.
